## Overview

This is the first landing page I've ever worked on and it was different from the previous card challenges. It was a simple page to code since there isn't much content in it. The layout is also very simple. However, I could not figure out how to fit the background image like it fits in the desgn. Other than that, I enjoyed creating this page and look forward to more challenges.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started by writing the HTML to put everthing in the right containers guided by the layout I had in mind. Then I used flexbox to position everything before I started styling elements. I then added the background image, color, font color, and set the font sizes. After I was done with styling the page's desktop view I set a media query breakpoint and added different styling so it could fit in mobile view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to write better HTML which is guided by the layout I want. I also learned how to import and use icons from font awesome as web fonts. The icons in the design had a circle around them and adding it was the tricky part, since they don't have them by default. I found a few tutorials and examples on how to do this but this was the simplest one I found and it worked just fine.  

I decided to apply it to the <i> tag since it just contains icons.

```css
i{
	color:white;
	border: 2px solid white;
	width: 3rem;
	height: 3rem;
	text-align: center;
	border-radius: 50%;
	line-height: 1rem;
	padding: 0.9rem;
	vertical-align: middle;
}
```
